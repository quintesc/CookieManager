# CookieManager
Project I'm working on for my sister who runs a bakery.
It's an interface to keep track of and add new orders, check completed/incomplete orders, etc.
Saves and loads data of clients and orders
Not finished yet, still want to add a few things
All these files are a single project, and to use you need to download all the .java files.
This uses a hashtable made by me, not the java.util.hashtable.
